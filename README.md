## 👋 Hi, I'm Evangelia, but I go by Eva for convenience.

Currently wrapping up my MSc in Digital Marketing, I've spent the last year building real projects with real tools: from GA4 reports and WordPress websites to SEO strategies, campaign content and HTML/CSS builds.

📌 I don’t come from a technical background, but I’ve always been drawn to the "why" behind customer behavior and that’s what led me to data-driven marketing. These days, I’m especially curious about how AI is reshaping strategy and decision-making. My thesis dives right into that.

💡 The kind of work that excites me?  
Interpreting data from platforms (GA4, CRM, socials, etc.) and using it to create tailored marketing plans that actually make sense, not just buzzwords. 

I work hard, I learn fast, and I’m not afraid to get my hands dirty. Balancing a full-time job, full-time master’s, German language learning and freelance projects taught me a thing or two about discipline, ownership, and staying curious.

🗂️ Most of my projects (HTML site, WordPress builds, campaign work, data reports) are private, but I’m happy to share access upon request.
